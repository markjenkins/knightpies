I've tagged and signed knightpies-0.2, my implementation of the Knight ISA in Python. (to eventually be merged with the stage0 project)

This release can interpret the instructions used by stage0/stage1/stage1_assembler-0.hex0 .

The other highlight of this release is the addition to the test suite of a test of hex0 encoding using fuzzing. This uncovered a bug (github issues/1) in my python hex0 encoder.

This fuzz test provides empirical evidence that the well commented blob stage0/stage0/stage0_monitor.hex0 does what it says it does. That's not a substitute for hand auditing that stage0_monitor.s co-responds to stage0_monitor.hex0, but it may offer some additional comfort.

The random generator for my fuzz test is seeded with the chosen plain text "What's GNU? Gnu's Not Unix!", the opening heading from the GNU Manifesto published in 1985.

Other blobs from stage0 will get the same treatment in later releases.
