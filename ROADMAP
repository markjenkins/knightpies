* items are implemented, but under tested by the current test suite 

0.3.5
 - Implement and test M1.py and M1tobin.py to assemble .s M1 files from all architechures

0.4
 - Implement enough instructions to execute stage1/M0-macro.hex2
   (use it to assemble all .s files)
STORE32
*CMP
LOAD32
LOAD8
SR0I
CMPSKIPI.L
MUL
SUBI
ADDU

0.4.5
 - Test by assembling and executing stage0/stage1/CAT.s

0.5.0
 - Implement enough instructions to execute stage0/stage2/forth.s
   (load stage0/stage3/inital_library.fs)
HAL_MEM
CMPSKIP.GE
DIV
SAL
SAR
CMPSKIP.E
CMPSKIP.G
OR
AND
CMPJUMPI.LE
NEG
* JUMP.NZ

0.6
 - Implement enough instructions to execute stage0/stage2/lisp.s
 (load stage0/stage3/ascension.scm)
[instruction TODO list here]

0.7
 - Implement all knightvm instructions used by stage2/cc_x86.s
 use it to build all stage0/stage3 c programs
[instruction TODO list here]

0.8
 - Implement all knightvm instructions emitted by M2 planet (and make full use of its test suite)
[instruction TODO list here]

0.8.5
 - Test by compiling M2-Planet to Knight ISA and then see if M2-knight binary can compile M2-Planet

1.0
 - Implement all knightvm instructions found in stage0/vm_instructions.c

Other TODOS prior to 1.0
 * Adding substantial comments, especially for the meta-programming
 * Convert further to a pseudo functional style so get_args_for_*OP functions can go away
 * Separate directly executable Python files from the rest, move library modules to a knightpy package
 * Adopting a compliant file system layout that could make this mergable with stage0
 * Performance test premature optimizations
