0.3.0 -- 2020-01-23
 - Additional instructions to interpret stage1_assembler-2
 - Python implementation of hex2 encoding/symbol linking
 - Test suite enhancements, including:
  * Fuzz testing of stage1_assembler-2 and framework enhanced to include heap space
  * Some of the testing from previous releases enhanced to cover variations in register size and optimized instructions for specific register sizes
  * Flags for test runner scripts to skip parallel test suite and variations of register size and optimizations for register size
  * Parallel testing suite enhanced to support style of I/O for stage1 roms and tested with stage1_assembler-2
 - New instructions for compatibility with stage0 Release_0.3.0 (1c91bd1dbefc7f6da611d7bdfc9f435690286690), but, git sub-module reference to stage0 not yet updated as parallel test suite needs further work (github issue #1)
 - Other minor bugs fixes, github issue #2, 397fe796d67808134f4a97e3a7b4f7bf2132c7a1, 3108a026a06217baff704e4b5c03d977591bd5e8, df36db496b7cd779c91e89cb700778dbcf4bb9af
 - Improvements towards python 2.2 compatibility goal

0.2.5 -- 2019-07-27
 - Additional instructions to interpret stage1_assembler-1
 - Python implementation of hex1 encoding
 - Shared test infrastructure for fuzz testing hex0-2 encoding
 - Fuzz testing for stage0/stage1/stage1_assembler-0 and stage1_assembler-1

0.2 -- 2019-06-15
 - Additional instructions required to interpret stage1_assembler-0
 - hex0 encoding fuzzing test (helped catch issue #1)
 - Mention of IronPython removed from README and RATIONAL as CPython on Windows (including versions available through the Microsoft Store) are sufficient from a diverse double compiling perspective because they are built with MSVC
 - Initial fixes re use of True/False/bool which breaks Python 2.2 support
 - Test runner shell script replaced with pure Python

0.1 -- 2019-05-04
 - Enough instructions implemented to interpret stage0_monitor
 - An initial test suite exercising above, including
  * Parallel execution with the original C knightvm with comparison of state and output
  * Our own implementation of hex0 file encoding and this is compared against published stage0 SHA256SUMS and execution of stage0_monitor on additional hex0 files from stage0 project
 - Git sub-module reference to stage0 Release_0.2.0
