0.2 -- 2019-06-15
 - Additional instructions required to interpret stage1_assembler-0
 - hex0 encoding fuzzing test (helped catch issue #1)
 - Mention of IronPython removed from README and RATIONAL as CPython on Windows (including versions available through the Microsoft Store) are sufficient from a diverse double compiling perspective because they are built with MSVC
 - Initial fixes re use of True/False/bool which breaks Python 2.2 support
 - Test runner shell script replaced with pure Python

0.1 -- 2019-05-04
 - Enough instructions implemented to interpret stage0_monitor
 - An initial test suite exercising above, including
  * Parallel execution with the original C knightvm with comparison of state and output
  * Our own implementation of hex0 file encoding and this is compared against published stage0 SHA256SUMS and execution of stage0_monitor on additional hex0 files from stage0 project
 - Git sub-module reference to stage0 Release_0.2.0
